Born and raised in a small town in Zimbabwe. Studied at Harare Institute of Technology and obtained a Bachelors degree in Information Security and Assurance. Started out as a Python developer, working on web applications and APIs. Developed an interest in offensive security through reading bug bounty posts on Medium. Currently working on gaining knowledge in vulnerabilities and how they occur, especially in the Linux kernel.

A huge fan of The Big Bang Theory and Silicon Valley. Can never get enough of ice cream. Still enjoy CTFs and plays around with them from time to time. Yet to conquer the Inyangani Mountain, located in the eastern highlands in Zimbabwe.
