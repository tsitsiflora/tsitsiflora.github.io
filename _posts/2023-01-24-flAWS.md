# AWS Security: A series of common mistakes

I have decided to take initiative and learn AWS security given the wide adoption of the cloud. Last year I sat for the AWS Cloud Pactitioner exam and passed, and I am hoping I can do another one. I've been contemplating doing the Solutions Architect but I am not really sure I need it. My goal is to pass the AWS Certified Security, since it is specialized. But I'm not sure if I can jump the steps like that. I'm gonna be using the [flAWS](http://flaws.cloud/) project by Scot Piper. 

In his own words, "Through a series of levels you'll learn about common mistakes and gotchas when using Amazon Web Services (AWS). There are no SQL injection, XSS, buffer overflows, or many of the other vulnerabilities you might have seen before. As much as possible, these are AWS specific issues." That is the flAWS project. I'll be doing more research into the mistakes and providing more details.

## Level 1

`This level is **buckets** of fun. See if you can find the first sub-domain.`

In the first hint we are told that the site is hosted in S# buckets as it is a great way to host static sites. Let's do a DNS lookup on the domain to confirm this:
